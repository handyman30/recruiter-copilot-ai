As a recruiter, I used to spend 3+ hours screening resumes for ONE position 😫

Yesterday I found AI that does it in 30 seconds.

• Uploaded job description ⬆️
• Uploaded 5 resumes ⬆️
• Got instant match scores (94%, 87%, 76%, 82%, 91%) 📊
• Saw skills analysis for each candidate 🎯

Time saved: 2 hours 45 minutes.
Accuracy: Higher than my manual screening.
Cost: FREE.

This changes everything for talent acquisition.
